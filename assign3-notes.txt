Assignment #3

    This assignment went well I think.  Mostly it was just the same
stuff, reading the code and understanding everything.  So I read the code
and tried to understand it.  Sat with it for a while.  Came back, 
tried to write the let function, failed... re read the code and sat with
it for some more time.  Once figured out let, then all the rest sort
of fell into place.  Assign came through, as did first and second, etc.
Did a recursive call for write which helped to create the recursive
call for deq.  Deq was a little tricky, but mostly it was just about
reading the instruction specifics and implementing it.
